# Investigating Netflix Movies

## Overview

This repository contains a DataCamp project where I apply the skills I learned in the courses "Introduction to Python" and "Intermediate Python", it contains the Jupyter Notebook "notebook.ipynb" that performs an in-depth analysis of the Netflix movies dataset.

## Usage

To run the notebook locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/patime07/Netflix_Movies_Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Netflix_Movies_Analysis
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.)

4. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Open `notebook.ipynb` in the browser and execute the cells sequentially to replicate the analysis.

## Requirements
