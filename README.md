# Investigating Netflix Movies
This is a small DataCamp project to apply the skills learned in the courses "Introduction to Python" and "Intermediate Python". The goal of this project is to discover if Netflixâ€™s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office".
